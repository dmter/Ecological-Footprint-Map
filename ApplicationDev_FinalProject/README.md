**Interactive Spatial Analysis of the Ecological Carbon Footprint of European Countries**

**Introduction: Why This Project Matters**
Imagine trying to understand your environmental impact using only static charts and tables. Not very intuitive, right? That’s the problem this project set out to solve.
Titled “Interactive Spatial Analysis of Ecological Footprint in Austria and Czechia Using Leaflet and Python,” this WebGIS application brings ecological data to life. Instead of relying on outdated visuals, it offers an interactive map that lets users explore how housing, food, and transportation contribute to carbon footprints—right down to the municipal level. It’s designed to be simple, engaging, and informative, especially for policymakers, researchers, and environmentally conscious citizens.

**The Challenge: Bridging the Gap Between Data and Insight**
While ecological footprint data is available at national and regional levels, it’s often hard to interpret or apply locally. The real challenge? Making that data interactive and geographically meaningful.
This project’s goal was to build a web-based tool that allows users to explore carbon footprint trends spatially—zooming in, clicking around, and truly understanding the environmental story behind each region.

**How It Works: Behind the Scenes of the WebGIS Tool**
The application is built on a two-part system: Python handles the data, and JavaScript (with Leaflet) powers the interactive map. Here’s how each part contributes:
Backend (Python)
The Python script, housed in app.py, does the heavy lifting with data. Using the pandas library, it:
•	Loads the raw data from a CSV file called eco.csv.
•	Groups and aggregates the data by region name, calculating population and CO₂ emissions per capita.
•	Exports a clean dataset into eco_merge.csv, ready for mapping.
This ensures the data is tidy, accurate, and optimized for visualization.
 Frontend (JavaScript + HTML)
The frontend is what users see and interact with. It’s made up of:
•	index.html: Sets up the webpage and links to Leaflet and custom scripts.
•	app.js: Brings the map to life.
Here’s what the map does:
•	Loads a GeoJSON file (merged.geojson) containing regional boundaries and footprint data.
•	Uses a color gradient to show CO₂ emissions per capita—darker shades mean higher emissions.
•	Adds pop-ups that appear when users click on a region, showing its name and footprint value.
•	Generates a dynamic legend to help users interpret the color scale.
The result? A sleek, interactive choropleth map that turns raw data into visual insight.

**Final Thoughts: What This Project Achieves**
This tool isn’t just a map—it’s a bridge between complex data and actionable understanding. By combining Python’s data-processing power with Leaflet’s intuitive mapping features, the project delivers a meaningful way to explore ecological footprints.
And it’s built to grow. Future enhancements could include time-based sliders to track changes over the years, or deeper analytical layers to compare regions more effectively.
In short: it’s a smart, scalable solution for anyone looking to make informed environmental decisions.
